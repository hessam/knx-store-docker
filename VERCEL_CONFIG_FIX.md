# 🔧 Vercel Configuration Fix Applied

## ❌ Issue Resolved:

**Error**: `If 'rewrites', 'redirects', 'headers', 'cleanUrls' or 'trailingSlash' are used, then 'routes' cannot be present.`

## ✅ Solution Applied:

### **Problem**: 
Vercel configuration had conflicting properties:
- `routes` property was present
- `redirects`, `rewrites`, and `headers` were also present
- These cannot be used together in modern Vercel configuration

### **Solution**:
Simplified `vercel.json` to use only essential properties:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "name": "knx-store",
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist",
  "env": {
    "NODE_ENV": "production"
  },
  "github": {
    "enabled": true,
    "silent": false
  },
  "git": {
    "deploymentEnabled": {
      "main": true,
      "develop": true,
      "preview": true
    }
  }
}
```

## 🗑️ Removed Properties:

- ❌ `routes` - Conflicted with other routing properties
- ❌ `redirects` - Not needed for basic deployment
- ❌ `rewrites` - Not needed for basic deployment  
- ❌ `headers` - Can be added later if needed
- ❌ `build.env` - Redundant with top-level `env`

## ✅ Kept Properties:

- ✅ `buildCommand` - Essential for Astro build
- ✅ `outputDirectory` - Points to Astro's dist folder
- ✅ `env` - Environment variables
- ✅ `github` - GitHub integration
- ✅ `git` - Deployment configuration

## 🚀 Expected Results:

After this fix:
- ✅ Vercel deployment should succeed
- ✅ No configuration conflicts
- ✅ Preview deployment should work
- ✅ Build process should complete

## 📊 Current Status:

- **Configuration**: ✅ Simplified and clean
- **Deployment**: ✅ Should work now
- **Preview System**: ✅ Ready for testing
- **Pushed to GitHub**: ✅ Yes

## 🔍 Next Steps:

1. **Monitor the PR**: Check if deployment succeeds
2. **Test Preview**: Visit the generated preview URL
3. **Verify Functionality**: Test the health API endpoint
4. **Add Features**: Build the actual e-commerce functionality

## 🛠️ If Issues Persist:

1. Check Vercel build logs
2. Verify environment variables are set
3. Ensure Vercel project is properly linked
4. Check if all dependencies are installed

**The Vercel configuration is now clean and should deploy successfully!** 🎯
