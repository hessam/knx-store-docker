- ✅ Automatic updates with new commits
- ✅ Cleanup when PR is closed/merged

## 📊 Test Checklist

### Before Creating PR:
- [ ] GitHub repository created
- [ ] Vercel credentials obtained
- [ ] GitHub secrets configured

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **"Workflow not triggered"**: Check if PR is to main/develop branch

4. **"Build errors"**: Review build logs in Actions tab

### Debug Commands:
```bash
# Check local status
git status
git log --oneline -3

docker-compose up -d
curl http://localhost:4001

# Check GitHub Actions
# Go to: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/knx-store-docker/actions
```
